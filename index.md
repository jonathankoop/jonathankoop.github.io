Hey! I'm Jonathan and my focus lies in improving quantitative methods in social science research, with a particular interest in R programming, network science, and digital trace data. My research experience spans a range of projects, from developing tools for students to explore their own GDPR data to working on data donation initiatives and survey analysis. I also enjoy diving into Bayesian statistics when I get the chance - this is also a key component of my Master thesis evolving around the usage of shrinkage priors in Relational Event Models.

Outside of my academic life, I like to stay active with football, running, and bouldering. This is a nice way to balance out the hours spent coding and spending some quality-time with friends.
