## Adaptive Playmaking: Incorparating Prior Knowledge in Analyzing Football Passes

In a project for a course on Bayesian statistics as part of the Master programme, I applied a Bayesian multinomial Probit model to Relational Event History data retrieved from passes played in two football matches of my favorite team, the [VfB Stuttgart](https://www.vfb.de/en/). In this context, I extended work by [Karimova et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.02.006), allowing the incorporation of results from previous analyses into the analysis through the specification of Normal priors.

In the application to football passes, player data was scraped from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com) to allow the inclusion of exogenous variables in the models.

## Evaluating the Effect of Buddy Programs on International Students at German Universities

In an internship at the [Bavarian State Institute for Higher Education Research and Planning](https://www.ihf.bayern.de/en/), together with [Susanne Falk](https://www.ihf.bayern.de/en/about-the-institute/academic-staff/falk-dr-susanne-1) and [Theresa Thies](https://www.ihf.bayern.de/en/about-the-institute/academic-staff/thies-theresa), I worked in a project assessing the impact of buddy and mentoring programs on international students enrolled at German universities. My responsibilities included identifying an appropriate methodological framework aimed at determining the causal effect of this treatment. This experience allowed me to delve into the realm of causal inference at an early stage. Subsequently, I utilized these methodologies to analyse survey data, which unveiled valuable insights to policy-makers. Furthermore, I actively contributed to the drafting and editing process of our manuscript, prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed academic journal.
